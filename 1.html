  <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" target="_blank" title="corona wikipedia">Coronavirus disease 2019 <u>(COVID-19)<a/></u></strong> is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus closely related to the SARS virus. The disease is the cause of the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak. It passes from one person to others via respiratory droplets produced from the airways, often during coughing or sneezing. Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between 2 and 14 days. Hand washing, maintaining distance from people who are coughing, and not touching one's face are recommended to prevent the disease. It is recommended to cover one's nose and mouth with a bent elbow when coughing.</p>
